# Project 2 

Creating a responsive website using flexbox. 

## The problem

Once I decided what to creat, I thought about how it should look like and and where specific content should be displayed. I started with the header and the nav, which turned out to be the most difficult part as it should be responsive and at the same time I wanted to use a submenu. I watched some youtube videos with different ways of creating a responsive nav.

When this was done, I created the card elements that should display the different DVDs. Using flexbox this turned out to be pretty straightforward. Unfortunately I made a mistake by using a dummy container that included the same DVDs like 7 times. So by using just one DVD, it looked okay. When I started to plug in other DVDs as well, I realized that my container was not able to manage different sizes of imgaes and titles and other elements. In ordet to solve this, I had to add a few more divs. 

I am okay with how the page looks like at the moment. But I think my code could be much simplified by chosing better classes and reusing them more often. I should probably print out the code and check which lines are redundant. 

The next step is implementing some javascript to make my cart work, as well as adding the form to sign up. 

Furthermore I think it would be much easier to manage (add, remove) the DVDs by using some kind of database instead of adding each of them individually to the HTML files. But this probably goes behind this course :) 

## View it live

I will deploy the project as soon as the cart and the sign-up parts are working properly.
